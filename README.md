# Final-Project
AI-Powered Personalized Learning Assistant for
School and College Students

Problem Statement:
In today’s education system, students have diverse learning speeds, styles, and
preferences. Traditional teaching methods often follow a "one-size-fits-all"
model, which leaves slow learners behind and fails to challenge fast learners.
Teachers are overwhelmed with managing large classrooms and cannot provide
individual attention. Moreover, students struggle to revise concepts effectively
and lack personalized guidance outside school hours. Current EdTech
platforms offer video content and static quizzes but do not adapt dynamically to
student behavior or performance.
There is a growing need for an AI-driven solution that can:
● Continuously assess student performance,
● Adapt content delivery accordingly,
● Generate practice questions, summaries, and explanations in real-time,
● Offer insights to educators about student progress and potential issues.

Business Use Cases:
● EdTech companies can integrate the solution into their LMS to provide
customized learning paths.
● Schools and colleges can use the assistant for remedial coaching and
curriculum support.
● Parents gain insights into their child’s learning behavior and can take early
action.
